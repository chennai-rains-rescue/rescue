It is a well-established finding in emergency management research that more people suffer (& even die) in the 1-2 month period following an emergency due to the inadequacies in relief operations (than during the rescue).

A lot of informal mechanisms (such as info sharing through Facebook & Twitter) might work in the short-run during the rescue operations, but not so much during the disbursement of reliefs. Most of the times, it leads to a few localities getting a lot of attention & help, while many others don't get any. Moreover, since word-of-mouth works only to an extent, volunteers & NGOs too inundate some areas with too many materials that eventually end up in the dumps. So whatever little we can do to minimize this will be great.

This project is about creating a website with geo-information through which volunteers, relief workers, and NGOs can share information, pool resources, and collaborate with each other so that relief work is not crowded to a single locality, but effectively distributed across different affected areas. For example, if NGOs and Volunteers want to know which area/street/individual is in most need of help (and what type of help), they should be able to find it through the website. If two NGOs or Volunteers want to share info among each other (e.g. finding out if someone is going to a same or nearby area to distribute materials, so that they can share a van),  the website should facilitate it. Think of it as a more structured and advanced version of chennairains.org, where past information is retained, and there is a way to search & flag new information as and when it is posted.
